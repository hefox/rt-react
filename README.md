## Usage

- [Run](#run)
- [Deploy](#deploy)
- [Source code](#source-code)
- [Clean source code](#clean-source-code)
- [Components](#components)
  - [Storybook](#storybook)

### Run

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use `npm start` to run a development server.

### Deploy

Use `npm run build` to transpile the code into the `dist` folder. Then, you can deploy it everywhere.

### Source code

The source code should be placed in `src`; public/static files should be placed in `public` so they can be included in the build process.

Because of [webpack's config](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/blob/5c752968c52d013f7218b514021eae08f6ddf07c/webpack.config.js#L19-L21), we can import our source modules without relative paths.
```js
import { Button, HomePage } from 'components' // src/components
import App from 'components/App' // src/components/App
import routes from 'routes' // src/routes
```
